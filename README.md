# Small Login System

A simple and lightweight PHP-based user authentication system built with MySQL and Bootstrap 4. This project provides a secure foundation for user registration, login, and profile management with modern security practicesâ€”perfect for getting your next project up and running quickly!

## Features

- **Dual Login Options**: Users can log in with either their email address or username
- **User Registration**: Complete user registration with validation
- **User Profile Management**: Display and manage user information after login
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed login attempts
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 4 for mobile-friendly interface
- **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing, validation, and SQL injection protection

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or similar)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP with object-oriented architecture
- **Database**: MySQL with prepared statements for security
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 4 for responsive design
- **Testing**: PHPUnit for comprehensive test coverage

## Database Schema

The system stores user data with the following fields:
- Username
- Email address
- First name
- Last name
- Mobile number
- Password (securely hashed)

## Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup
- Copy [`config/db.sample.php`](config/db.sample.php) to `config/db.php`
- Update the database connection settings in [`config/db.php`](config/db.php)
- Create your MySQL database and ensure proper permissions

### 2. Installation
- Clone or download this repository to your web server directory
- Ensure PHP and MySQL are properly configured and running
- Install dependencies if needed (PHPUnit for testing)

### 3. Launch
- Navigate to [`index.php`](index.php) in your web browser
- The system will automatically create the necessary database tables on first use
- Start registering users and testing the login functionalityâ€”you're all set!

## Security Features

This system implements multiple layers of security protection to keep your users safe:

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use prepared statements with parameter binding
- **Session Security**: Comprehensive session protection with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict cookie flags
- **Input Validation**: Thorough sanitization of all user inputs
- **Password Security**: Secure password hashing using PHP's `password_hash()` function
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookie attributes prevent cross-site request forgery
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and HttpOnly cookies prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Cookie-only sessions with no URL-based session IDs

For detailed information about recent security improvements, see [`SECURITY_FIXES.md`](SECURITY_FIXES.md).

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/

# Run security-specific tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/SqlInjectionTest.php

# Run session security tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/SessionSecurityTest.php
```

Tests cover:
- SQL injection prevention
- Session security and cookie protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Email validation compatibility
- Security boundary testing
